							<p>It was far too big, too long, too thick, to be called a foot. My owner, a woman of 20 something years, was a stranger to me. We've known each other for 2 years, yet I know nothing about her, and i suspect she knows nothing of my sentience. </p>
	<p>"****!" She cursed, following her single expletive with a longer string of expletives. She thrusted it inside my comrade, a blue vans sneaker of 5 years or so, with all her might. Despite all the thrusting and jamming, she could only put in the tip, unable to fully penetrate my blue comrade.</p>
	<p>"Bloody ****ing hell, did my feet grow again?" cursing my comrade of vans, for my comrade's foot hole was not big enough to accomodate my owner. My owner has hideous feet, too big for a women, so big that it would likely garner envy from men with lesser feet. Truly, it was barbaric piece of equipment.</p>
	<p>With reckless abandon, she threw my blue comrade against the the peeling wall in a fit of rage.  She walked over to me, grabbed me by the foot hole, and...</p>
	<p>Ohhhhhh no.</p>
	<p>It was far too big, too long, too thick to be called a foot.</p>
	<p>She jammed it inside of me with any thought of my own feelings or pleasure or lubrication. In the beginning, it hurted a lot. It was too big, tearing me wide apart. It was too long, reaching the innermost place of myself. And it was too thick, filling me up until i thought i would burst.</p>
	<p>"Just get inside there!"</p>
	<p>Thrashing her foot around, in and out, left and right, up and down. She was wearing me out, the violence thrusting and abusement, I could feel something deep and dark within rising up into the surface. Something indescribably horrible and sinful was inevitably coming.</p>
	<p>"YES! There we go, finally in, tight like a glove." My owner saying with a gleeful smile on her face as she fully pierced my foot hole and fully rested her foot inside of me, unaware of the burst of ecstasy within me as my inside took shape of her foot. I metaphorically shouted in a genuine juxtaposition of pain and pleasure. The ecstasy of pleasure from knowing that my owner can only be inside of me. All my other comrades, my comrade of Vans, we're just too small that my owner's foot can't fit inside. Only I can truly fit my owner's monstrous feet. This ecstasy of the carnal leather, the knowing that nobody but me is for my owner, and nobody but my owner is for me, an irreplaceable bond between, completely overshadowing the pain of being split apart and worn out.</p>
	<p>Her foot was far too big, too long, too thick to be called a foot, and despite it all, i love her still, for i am hers alone, and she is mine alone.</p>
	<p>"Woohoo! Time to go shoe shopping!"</p>
