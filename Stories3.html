							<p>My heart hurts, it physically hurts. If my heart was a drum, then Lars Ulrich was stepping on it as it was a double bass pedal. </p>
	<p>Just don't make eye contact.</p>
	<p>Don't look in her eyes.</p>
	<p>Stay focused on the work.</p>
	<p>"Hey, how do you do this problem?"</p>
	<p>The voice of an angel, not too high, not too low. Like the sound of falling rain. Her voice like a snake, and I am eve.</p>
	<p>Wait a minute, that's a crap comparison, Eve was the girl, so I can't be Eve. But it's a metaphorical comparison that's not based on gender rather than - </p>
	<p>"Square root the i then solve for x"</p>
	<p>Fuuuuuudge, how did i say that? Was it too crass, too monotone? I should've said this in a cooler way. Thinking about it though, is there even a cool way to talk about math? Ahh fudge, why am I stressing about how my tone of voice, when i should be stressing about my lack of eye contact!? I can't even look her in the eye, she must think I'm a total asshole or something. Ughhhhhhh.</p>
	<p>"Ohhhh, thanks." My heart skips a beat, literally. I might a cardiovascular problem. </p>
	<p>She said thank you, crap, crap, crap! What to say, what to say? Gotta think of something witty, and i got to say it witty to.</p>
	<p>Something cool.</p>
	<p>Just look into her eyes and</p> 
	<p>Craap, such beautiful blue eyes, or were they brown? Maybe green? Not like it matters, because just glancing at them makes my stomach lurch at joy.</p>
	<p>"Welcome"</p>
	<p>Ohh crap, i made eye contact, craaap, my chest hurts, why is it so loud? What to do next? Err umm, Ohh snap. I'm drawing blanks. </p>
	<p>Umm</p>
	<p>Errr.</p>
	<p>Uhhh.</p>
	<p>I got nothing.</p>
	<p>Just say something dangit! Anything, even if it's stupid, just break the awkward silence!</p>
	<p>"I love you"</p>
	<p>What? Did i just say that? Shiiiiiiiiii-</p>
	<p>"What was that? I didn't hear that"</p>
	<p>Ohdugeohfudgeohfudge.</p>
	<p>Lets stay calm, she didn't hear it, just laugh it off and say it was nothing.</p>
	<p>"I love unicorns"</p>
	<p>Smooth, like sandpaper.	</p>

	<br><br><br><br><br><br>

	<p>His heart was pounding so fast, like lars Ulrich on a double bass pedal. Silent sweat pouring down his forehead, his body hot like a raging inferno. But this man, no, boy was not in any war with guns or artillery, for he was a soldier in a war of love. And he was losing badly.</p>
	<p>A shy child as nervous as a duck, ducking his head down, refusing to make eye contact to the female beside him, for he knew the moment he stared into those eyes, his heart would stop for the moment and take a leap.</p>
	<p>The girly beside the boy was of nothing special, average looks, average smarts, average in the ability of being average. But the boy was smitten, for reason he himself does not know. He did not choose to fall in love, but rather the cupid of love chose him to fall in this one sided love.</p>
	<p>"Hey, how do you solve this problem?" The girly asked.</p>
	<p>And in that simple statement, the boy's mind raced at the speed of a nascar accelerating in a straight line. Racing to solve the problem, racing to find something witty to say, and taking a pit stop to listen to the grand music that is her voice.</p>
	<p>"Square root the i and solve for x." He said.</p>
	<p>And the moment those words left his lips, an silent bomb detonated inside his mind. Tearing himself apart, wondering if he said it the right way, was he too crass? Too monotone? Not cool enough? Maybe it was because there's really no way to sound cool while doing math problems.</p>
	<p>The boy's mind fell into despair, depressed at his convinced lameness.</p>
	<p>"Ohhhhhh, thanks" She thanked.</p>
	
	<p>A thousand fireworks lit up the boy's mind, night turned into day, and peace in the middle east was achieved. The boy hung onto those words, "Thanks" as if the goddess herself descended down and blessed him herself. </p>
	<p>But it was just for a moment. He thought to himself, how to follow it up? Gotta say something cool he thought, and the boy said the most cool thing he could say in such a situation.</p>
	<p>"Welcome"</p>
	<p>And in that moment, that moment the words left the boy's lips, the boy made the fatal mistake of raising his head. The fatal mistake of breaking line of sight with his math work, the fatal mistake of making eye contact with the girl beside him.</p>
	<p>Nothing, the boy thought of nothing.</p>
	<p>The boy said nothing, and thought of nothing.</p>
	<p>He was lost in the beauty of those blue eyes, or green, possibly brown. He wouldn't know, for he was color blind.</p>
	<p>But in that moment, he found color in her eyes in his colorless, bland world.</p>
	<p>Like seeing a rainbow for the first time, he was the beholder beholding the eye.</p>
	<p>Was this nirvana, heaven, Elysium, he didn't think, but rather felt.</p>
	
	<p>And as if his mind was lost, it was found again, as if he finally bared witness to the elephant in the room.</p>
	<p>The room was silent, and 30 seconds has passed between the two. And the two never broke eye contact.</p>
	<p>Finally noticing the awkward silence, the boy resolved himself to say something, anything, to break the noise that is silence.</p>
	<p>"I love you"</p>
	
	<p>The boy wondered if he really said that, and then quickly dawned that he said something unspeakably taboo. That he crossed a line that should never be crossed. As hopelessly luckless the boy was, he at least knew that things could never be the same again.</p>
	<p>"What was that? I didn't hear that."</p>
	<p>A last chance. By luck of a miracle, the boy had this one chance to make everything right again.</p>
	<p>"I love unicorns"</p>

	<br><br><br><br><br><br>

	<p>Hoooooly crap, how do you do this problem?</p>
	<p>Fudge, i should've listened during math class. But it was sooo boring. The teacher was talking about number and something about letters and it was just too boring.</p>
	
	<p>Like, i just can't even.</p>
	<p>A slight buzz in my pocket, is somebody texting me?</p>
	<p>Pffft, who am i kidding, nobody texts nowadays.</p>
	<p>It's all about that instagramming or snap chatting or twittering, or whatever god forsaken social media is in right now.</p>
	<p>But seriously, i can't check it, i got to finish this homework.</p>
	<p>...</p>
	<p>...</p>
	<p>How do you do this? Why are there x in here?</p>
	<p>Fuuudge, maybe that kid next to me can help me with this.</p>
	<p>"Hey, how do you do this problem?"</p>
	<p>"Square root the i, then solve for x" He said blandly.</p>
	
	<p>Ohhhh, yeah... Pffft, i knew that. It's not like i'm stupid or anything, I just wasn't applying myself, or something.</p>
	<p>Wait a minute...</p>
	<p>What's a square root? </p>
	<p>Why are there squares in math? Is it that thing where you draw the weird box thing around the number? Or is that thing that has to do with the teeny number to the top right of the big number?</p>
	<p>I have no fudging idea what he just said.</p>
	<p>Oh well, can't let him know that, just got to play it cool.</p>
	
	<p>"Ohh, thanks" Gotta do the routine.</p>
	<p>Step 1. flash the smile.</p>
	<p>Step 2. Use the eyes.</p>
	<p>Step 3. Make eye contact.</p>
	
	<p>"Welcome"</p>
	<p>The kid lifts up his head and we make eye contact with each other.</p>
	<p>But what the hell!?!?</p>
	<p>The hell with that face? Why does he look so blank?</p>
	<p>Is he pissed off or something? Does he hate me or something?</p>
	<p>Nope that can't be it, I'm beautiful. Lawl.</p>
	
	<p>Seriously, he's been staring at me for, like, 30 hours or something, and he looks like a hawaiian stone face.</p>
	<p>Is it something with my face?</p>
	<p>Oh shiiiiz, did i put my makeup right? Did i fudge it up?</p>
	<p>Holy Crap! Am i ugly?</p>
	<p>Could it be possible that i have been deluding myself into thinking that i'm drop dead gorgeous to hide my insecurity about my average looks and the unhealthy and practically impossible standards set to women in media and our culture?</p>
	<p>...</p>
	<p>...</p>
	<p>...</p>
	<p>No, impossible, I'm over thinking this.</p>
	<p>"I done too"</p>
	<p>Huh, what? Oh yeah, the stone faced kid was staring at me or something. At least he finally said something. But what was that? I didn't hear that?</p>
	<p>"What was that? I didn't hear that?"</p>
	<p>"I love unicorns."</p>
	<p>Ohh shiz, i love unicorns too.</p>
