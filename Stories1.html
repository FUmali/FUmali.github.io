						<p>Maybe it's because i never liked clear skies. The vast emptiness of the sky above always filled me with some kind of boredom. As if the sky was empty and there was nothing above. If it was raining, i could feel the sky on my skin through the falling raindrops.</p>
	<p>Maybe it's because I liked the rain jokes. Cynical family members perverting the purple dinosaur's "Rain, Rain, Go Away" song. </p>
	<p>Maybe it's because the rain is the perfect excuse. It's raining, so let's just stay inside today. It's raining, so let's just watch the T.V. And waste the time away. It's raining, so let's drink some of  that hot coffee, hit the couch and play some games. It's raining, so lets just stay in bed, 3 layers of blankets, closed shutters, and me napping the morning away.</p>
	<p>It's raining, so lets not do that thing that we were suppose to do today. </p>
